# minigrep

`minigrep` is a toy CLI application developed in [chapter 12 of the Rust Lang book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch12-00-an-io-project.html).

It searches for a given query string in a file, and prints out any lines containing the query string.
Supports both case-sensitive and case-insensitive searches.

Fun stuff.
